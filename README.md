I review and comment on papers about machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and optimization. 

1. Pushing the Limits of Large Language Model Quantization via the Linearity Theorem
https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17525
2. Dense Communication between Language Models
https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12741
